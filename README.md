This was actually the first tkinter project I made a long time ago but never uploaded to Github.
As it is a simple calculator it only has the following operations (please keep in mind it can only do 1 operation at a time before you have to press "=")

- Add
- Subtract
- Divide
- Multiply
- Modulo
- X²  (x^2)
- Xⁿ  (x^any number you want)
